# Deep Learning-Assisted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DA-DMD)

---

### ðŸ”¬ Overview
**DA-DMD** is a physics-informed framework currently established for removing non-resonant background (NRB) in 
Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (**CARS**) using:

- **Unsupervised DMD:** Hankelized Dynamic Mode Decomposition with 2-class clustering   
- **DA-DMD:** Deep Learning with channel attention + CNN (Adaptive weighting of DMD modes for robust Raman signal recovery)

### ðŸ“„ Paper
Our method is described in:  
**Deep Learning-Assisted Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Non-resonant Background Removal in CARS Spectroscopy**  
Proceeding at *DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR 2025)*
